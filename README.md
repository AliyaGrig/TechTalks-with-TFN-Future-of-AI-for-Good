# TechTalks-with-TFN-Future-of-AI-for-Good

I participated as a guest speaker in "TechTalks with Хэштег#TFN, Future of AI for Good" in Homegrown, London. 

I’ve been doing research in Хэштег#ConsciousAI for the last 6 years and in my talk, I shared the novel Хэштег#AIArchitecture with the ability to empathize, understand, and self-awareness, thus forging deeper connections with human experiences. The goal of my Хэштег#AI initiatives goes beyond task-oriented AI; we're nurturing AI capable of understanding and relating to human emotions and situations. I believe this can help to train AI with the ability to create, and not just generate information.

I also shared the progress in our development at the Kosmos Foundation of Хэштег#robots for manufacturing and engineering tasks. These robots, designed for effective collaboration with human workers, enhance productivity and foster a collaborative work environment.

We had a great discussion during the panel with esteemed experts like Ariana Alexander-Sefre, Adam Liska, and Paul Miller OBE. They offered insights across a spectrum of AI applications. Their thoughts covered everything from mental health advancements to business process optimization and the influence on venture capital, painting a full picture of AI's extensive impact.

A big shoutout to Akansha Dimri, Founder and Editor of Tech Funding News  whose masterful moderation made the event a success. 

Happy to be a part of this amazing discussion about the AI future that promises not just technological innovation but also compassion, empathy, and inclusivity.
